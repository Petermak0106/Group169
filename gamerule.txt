Battle
Before the battle, players can choose the number of items to be used in the battle.
Both players will begin the battle by 3 bases.
A player wins when he or she destroys all three bases of the other player.

The 2 players can choose to roll a dice to gain game points, build attacking tools, attack another player, or defend themselves.
For rolling a dice, players will be provided the dice they have, which are default or can be bought at the Shop.
They can earn gamepoints for building attacking or defensive tools.
For attacking, players can choose to build attack tools or to attack another player with their existing batteries or launch an air fighter.
A boom with 1 attack point can destroy a defender or minus the HP of a protective cover by 1.
An air fighter can overlook defenders and destroy the protective cover or the base of another player directly.
For defending, players can either build a defender or a protective cover.
A protective cover with HP of 2 protects the bases directly from both booms and air fighters.
A defender with 1 HP can only defend from booms.
